## Steps taken

1. Run `create-react-app --template typescript`
1. Install desired packages: `leaflet`, `redux`, `react-redux`
1. Strip out unwanted files generated by create-react-app
1. study typescript basics (first time using it)
1. lay out redux boilerplate
1. lay out top navigation section
  - tweak `button:hover` to fade in the bottom border with css transition
  - tweak font and spacing to line up buttons with mockup
1. lay out map info (left) section
  - add padding around content of section
  - ensure similar alignment regardless of scrollbar size
1. Small meta-development project: "View Mode" feature
  - CTRL+1,2,3 will switch view modes to see the mockup or the app.
  - I find this very helpful to lock down sizing. No guesswork.
  - This feature is completely contained within 'assets/dev-script.js'
1. create search form
  - search input, select, and submit
  - input and submit appear combined as mockup displays
1. lay out results
1. aquire info icon from iconmonstr.com. Color it to match mockup.
1. embed leaflet map



## Things I learned while working on this project

1. Typescript basics.
1. Redux has hooks that (more tursely) accomplishes what `connect()` can do.
1. CSS experimental property 
  [`appearance`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/appearance)
  which instructs the browser to render the element as one of many options.
  I used `appearance: none` to help draw a custom `<select>`.
